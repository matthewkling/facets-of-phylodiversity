# Facets of phylodiversity

This repository contains supporting material associated with the study entitled "Facets of phylodiversity: parsing the value of anagenesis, cladogenesis, and evolutionary time in spatial conservation prioritization," currently in review:

An [R script](prioritize.R) with functions implementing our reserve selection algortihm.

A [CSV file](rankings.csv) containing our prioritization results.

Our analysis was based on previously published input datasets that are also available online, including [herbarium records](https://doi.org/10.6078/D1KX0V), [phylogenetic trees](https://doi.org/10.6078/D1VD4P), and [species distribution model](https://doi.org/10. 6078/D1QQ2S) scripts.

The authors of this study are Matthew Kling, Brent Mishler, Andrew Thornhill, Bruce Baldwin, and David Ackerly.
